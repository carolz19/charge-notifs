# Charge Notifs
A minimalist menu-bar app for macOS that notifies you to stop charging when your battery level is above 80% and to start charging when it's below 20%. 

**NOTE:** Unfortunately, this is only available on macOS Mojave since I currently can't figure out a workaround for registering for APNs without an Apple Developer account.
